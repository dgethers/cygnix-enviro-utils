jpassaro's Merge Tools
======================
These scripts are intended to automate certain tedious svn branches processes,
especially under process constraints that restrict your ability to merge
revisions all at once.

For example, with this script, you can automatically merge every eligible
revision with a separate check-in:

$ ./see-eligible ps
$ for x in $(cat listrevs_ecn-ps.trunk.txt) ; do
>   ./bring-merge.sh ps $x && ./status.sh ps && ./check-in.sh ps
> done

It will furthermore display the changes to be merged and wait for your
physical confirmation before checking in.

Tools are also included for easy record-only merges, including the endless
build checkins of a Maven build process, or other merges.

Individual scripts may be ill-documented, contact the author with any questions.


Setting Up
==========
The scripts as originally written invoke each other on the assumption that a)
they are in the same directory, and b) they are in a projects directory with
each source project eligible for merges represented by a different directory.
(Further assumptions are made about the names of those directories, an
shortcoming to be remedied in a future commit.) To facilitate the portability of
these utilities, a setup script is included.

To set up your projects directory for merging, invoke the setup script from said
projects directory. It will create symbolic links. 

$ ls
[... snip ...]
ecn-ps/
ecn-gs/
ecn-common/
[... snip ...]
$ git clone ^^/merge-tools ~/github-repos/jpassaro-merge-tools
[ ... snip ...]
$ ~/github-repos/jpassaro-merge-tools/setup.sh

You must also specify which branch you are merging from. There are two ways
to do this:

1) specify in branch.txt, which should contain only the text "BRANCH=trunk" or
whatever...

2) or set and export the environment variable BRANCH.
