# cygnix-enviro-utils

This is a storage place and show-off repository for the accumulated utilities
I'ver written over time to accommodate common tasks in Unix and Cygwin.

The tasks are organized according to what is generally unix-usable, what is
specific to Cygwin, and what is specific to work (most or all of which likely
will not make it up here).

It is recommended to install these to a location of your choosing, then to
symlink the contents into your home directory.  ${GIT_HOME}/bashrc should be
either symlinked to ~/.bashrc, or sourced from same under a different name.

All code is made available under the GPL, see LICENSE.

TODO:

bring this up to date with my current work situation -- this snapshot is from
  20 Oct and some commands may no longer apply.

try out the stuff in https://github.com/Russell91/sshrc and make sure it plays
nice with this...
